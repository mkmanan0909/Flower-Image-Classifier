# Flower-Image-Classifier

In this project, I trained an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers. You can imagine using something like this in a phone app that tells you the name of the flower your camera is looking at. I used the dataset of 102 flower categories.

The project is broken down into multiple steps:
1. Load and preprocess the image dataset
2. Train the image classifier on your dataset
3. Use the trained classifier to predict image content
I'll lead you through each part which I've implement in Python.
